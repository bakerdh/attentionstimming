@article{Gramfort2013,
	abstract = {Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the weak electromagnetic signals generated by neuronal activity in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and locate neural activation in the brain is a challenge that requires expertise in physics, signal processing, statistics, and numerical methods. As part of the MNE software suite, MNE-Python is an open-source software package that addresses this challenge by providing state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in Python that cover multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. Moreover, MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python libraries for scientific comptutation (NumPy, SciPy) and visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the greater neuroimaging ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel package. The code is provided under the new BSD license allowing code reuse, even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has only been under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly evolved with expanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated during code development to help share best practices. MNE-Python also gives easy access to preprocessed datasets, helping users to get started quickly and facilitating reproducibility of methods by other researchers. Full documentation, including dozens of examples, is available at http://martinos.org/mne.},

@article{Varni1979,
	abstract = {The present investigation studied observational learning in autistic children. Fifteen autistic and 15 normal children watched an adult model engage in a set of behaviors under specific verbal instructions. After observing this situation, the children were tested to determine what they had acquired through observation. The results showed that (1) the majority of the autistic and the youngest normal children acquired only some limited features of the observational situation and (2) chronological age was related to the amount of learning through observation in the normal children but not in the autistics. The deficit that the autistic children showed in observational learning may be related to a failure to discriminate or attend to the total stimulus input presented. Their failure in observational learning can be seen to contribute in a major way to the severely impoverished behavioral repertoires of these children.},

@article{Tse2018,
	abstract = {Considerable evidence has shown that physical exercise could be an effective treatment in reducing stereotypical autism spectrum disorder (ASD) behaviors in children. The present study seeks to examine the underlying mechanism by considering the theoretical operant nature of stereotypy. Children with ASD (n = 30) who exhibited hand-flapping and body-rocking stereotypies were asked to participate in both control (story-time) and experimental (ball-tapping-exercise intervention) conditions. The experimental condition comprised 15 min of ball tapping during which the children were asked to tap a plastic ball as many times as they could. Results indicated that hand-flapping stereotypy was significantly reduced but body-rocking stereotypy following the ball-tapping-exercise intervention was not. These results not only confirm the positive impact of exercise intervention on stereotypic behavior as shown in many previous studies, but further suggest that physical exercise should be matched with the biomechanics of stereotypy to produce a desirable behavioral benefit.},

@article{Rong2021,
	abstract = {Background
Comorbidity with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is very common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), worsening the developmental trajectory of ASD. The reported rates of ADHD in ASD vary widely. However, no meta-analysis has been conducted specifically to assess both the current and lifetime prevalence of ADHD in ASD. This study aims to fill in this gap.
Method
We searched the Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Embase databases for eligible articles published between January 1, 2000, and September 5, 2020. The risk of bias tool was used to assess the studies' quality. Overall pooled estimates of the current and lifetime prevalence of ADHD in ASD were obtained using random-effects models. Study heterogeneity was examined by Q and I2 statistics.
Findings
A total of 63 articles were eventually included, of which 56 studies reported the current prevalence, and 13 studies reported the lifetime prevalence. The results revealed that the pooled current and lifetime prevalence rates of ADHD among ASD were 38.5 % (95 % CI 34.0--43.2) and 40.2 % (95 % CI 34.9--45.7), respectively. Our study also confirmed that age, intellectual disability, recruitment settings, and diagnostic criteria significantly influenced the current prevalence of ADHD in ASD.
Conclusion
ASD has considerable high current or lifetime prevalence rates of co-occurring ADHD. The findings demonstrate that clinicians should consider the high prevalence of ADHD in ASD and especially stay alert to possible ADHD diagnoses in school-age children and adolescents with ASD. Medical institutions should improve the assessment and tracking system of ADHD comorbidity in ASD and maximize the diagnostic accuracy for better treatment.},

	abstract = {In the present study, we used a multiple baseline design across participants to assess the efficacy of a video modeling intervention to teach six children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to assertively respond to bullying. During baseline, the children made few appropriate responses upon viewing video clips of bullying scenarios. During the video modeling intervention, participants viewed videos of models assertively responding to three types of bullying: physical, verbal bullying, and social exclusion. Results indicated that all six children learned through video modeling to make appropriate assertive responses to bullying scenarios. Four of the six children demonstrated learning in the in situ bullying probes. The results are discussed in terms of an intervention for victims of bullying with ASD.},

Compared to interventions for social-communication skills, less attention has been given to RRBIs, especially with regard to interventions for young children. We surveyed 128 behavior analysts who implemented interventions for young children with ASD on their use of 16 practices and one assessment for the treatment of RRBIs. The majority of our sample perceived the practices to be effective in producing sustainable behavior change. Behavior analysts generally responded in the same way to items about reinforcement-based practices, punishment-based practices, and a group of commonly packaged antecedent and consequence-based package components. Implications and future directions are discussed.},

@article{Pierce2001,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although limited environmental exploration in autism is an obvious behavioral feature and may be a manifestation of "restricted interests" as described in DSM-IV criteria, there have been no behavioral or neurobiological studies of this important aspect of the disorder. Given consistent reports of cerebellar abnormality in autism, combined with animal research showing a relationship between exploration and the cerebellum, this study aimed to test the possible link between cerebellar abnormality and exploration in autism.
METHODS: The relationship between visuospatial exploration, stereotyped motor movements, and magnetic resonance imaging measures of the cerebellar vermis, whole brain volume, and frontal lobes in 14 autistic and 14 normal children was investigated. Children were exposed to a large room with several exploration containers and instructed to play. Exploration behavior was videotaped and scored for percentage of time engaged in exploration, number of containers explored, as well as stereotyped movements.
RESULTS: Children with autism spent significantly less time in active exploration and explored fewer containers overall than normal children. Measures of decreased exploration were significantly correlated with the magnitude of cerebellar hypoplasia of vermal lobules VI-VII in the autistic children, but no relationship to vermis size was found with normal control children. Further, measures of rates of stereotyped behavior were significantly negatively correlated with area measures of cerebellar vermis lobules VI-VII and positively correlated with frontal lobe volume in the autism sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced environmental exploration and repetitive behavior may have particularly important developmental consequences for children with autism because it may lead them to miss learning opportunities that fall outside their scope of interest. Our findings represent the first documented link between the restricted range of interests and stereotyped behaviors pathognomonic of autism and particular neuroanatomic sites.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study were to investigate how adult patients with ADHD coped with their symptoms prior to diagnosis and treatment, what skills and compensation strategies they had developed and what their self-perceptions of these strategies were.
METHODS: We used a qualitative approach to analyze interviews with 32 outpatients of a specialty care unit at a university hospital.
RESULTS: Patients reported frequent use of diverse compensatory strategies with varying degrees of effectiveness. These were classified into five categories (organizational, motoric, attentional, social, psychopharmacological). In certain circumstances, ADHD symptoms were even perceived as useful.
CONCLUSION: Before diagnosis and treatment, patients with ADHD may develop a variety of skills to cope with their symptoms. Several of these skills are perceived as helpful. Knowledge of self-generated coping strategies may help better understand patients and their histories and thus facilitate patient cooperation. Moreover, knowing ways in which such patients cope with their symptoms may help elucidate reasons for late or under-diagnosing of the disorder.},

Children responded to measures of attitudes (Adjective Checklist) and behavioral intentions (Shared Activities Questionnaire). Children rated the typical boy more favorably than the boy showing autistic symptoms. When compared to descriptive information alone, the combination of descriptive and explanatory information resulted in improved third- and fourth-graders' but not fifth-graders' attitudes toward the child with autism. Combined information improved behavioral intentions across grades; however, girls (vs. boys) were more responsive to information as evidenced by differences in academic intentions. The combination of descriptive and explanatory information about autism appears to have a positive effect on children's attitudes and behavioral intentions.

As is commonly known, it is not possible to state evidence for the null hypothesis in conventional significance testing. Here we highlight a Bayes factor alternative to the conventional t test that will allow researchers to express preference for either the null hypothesis or the alternative. The Bayes factor has a natural and straightforward interpretation, is based on reasonable assumptions, and has better properties than other methods of inference that have been advocated in the psychological literature. To facilitate use of the Bayes factor, we provide an easy-to-use, Web-based program that performs the necessary calculations.},

EEGLAB functions are organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data processing using command history and interactive 'pop' functions. Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts. Extensive function help and tutorial information are included. A 'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu.

In this review, we provide a summary of recent findings, discuss limitations in available research that may contribute to inconsistencies in the literature, and offer suggestions for future research in this area for advancing the understanding of ASD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) experience atypical visual perception, yet the etiology of this remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the neural correlates of visual perception in individuals with and without ASD by carrying out a detailed analysis of the dynamic brain processes elicited by perception of a simple visual stimulus.
METHODS: We investigated perception in 20 individuals with ASD and 20 control subjects with electroencephalography (EEG). Visual evoked potentials elicited by Gabor patches of varying spatial frequency and stimulus-induced changes in alpha- and gamma-frequency bands of independent components were compared in those with and without ASD.
RESULTS: By decomposing the EEG data into independent components, we identified several processes that contributed to the average event related potential recorded at the scalp. Differences between the ASD and control groups were found only in some of these processes. Specifically, in those components that were in or near the striate or extrastriate cortex, stimulus spatial frequency exerted a smaller effect on induced increases in alpha- and gamma-band power, and time to peak alpha-band power was reduced, in the participants with ASD. Induced alpha-band power of components that were in or near the cingulate gyrus was increased in the participants with ASD, and the components that were in or near the parietal cortex did not differ between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Atypical processing is evident in individuals with ASD during perception of simple visual stimuli. The implications of these data for existing theories of atypical perception in ASD are discussed.},

Our goal is to narrow the gap between SZ and ASD and, ultimately, give support to the view that they represent abnormal (but related) ontogenetic itineraries for the human faculty of language. We will focus on the distinctive oscillatory profiles of the SZ and ASD brains, in turn using these insights to refine our understanding of how the brain implements linguistic computations by exploring a novel model of linguistic feature-set composition. We will argue that brain rhythms constitute the best route to interpreting language deficits in both conditions and mapping them to neural dysfunction and risk alleles of the genes. Importantly, candidate genes for SZ and ASD are overrepresented among the gene sets believed to be important for language evolution. This translational effort may help develop an understanding of the aetiology of SZ and ASD and their high prevalence among modern populations.},

	abstract = {Atypical visual perception in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is hypothesized to stem from an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory processes in the brain. We used neuronal oscillations in the gamma frequency range (30-90 Hz), which emerge from a balanced interaction of excitation and inhibition in the brain, to assess contextual modulation processes in early visual perception. Electroencephalography was recorded in 12 high-functioning adults with ASD and 12 age- and IQ-matched control participants. Oscillations in the gamma frequency range were analyzed in response to stimuli consisting of small line-like elements. Orientation-specific contextual modulation was manipulated by parametrically increasing the amount of homogeneously oriented elements in the stimuli. The stimuli elicited a strong steady-state gamma response around the refresh-rate of 60 Hz, which was larger for controls than for participants with ASD. The amount of orientation homogeneity (contextual modulation) influenced the gamma response in control subjects, while for subjects with ASD this was not the case. The atypical steady-state gamma response to contextual modulation in subjects with ASD may capture the link between an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neuronal processing and atypical visual processing in ASD.},

@article{Berman2015,
	abstract = {Adult studies have shown that a basic property of resting-state (RS) brain activity is the coupling of posterior alpha oscillations (alpha phase) to posterior gamma oscillations (gamma amplitude). The present study examined whether this basic RS process is present in children. Given reports of abnormal parietal-occipital RS alpha in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the present study examined whether RS alpha-to-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is disrupted in ASD. Simulations presented in this study showed limitations with traditional PAC analyses. In particular, to avoid false-positive PAC findings, simulations showed the need to use a unilateral passband to filter the upper frequency band as well as the need for longer epochs of data. For the human study, eyes-closed RS magnetoencephalography data were analyzed from 25 children with ASD and 18 typically developing (TD) children with at least 60 sec of artifact-free data. Source modeling provided continuous time course data at a midline parietal-occipital source for PAC analyses. Greater alpha-to-gamma PAC was observed in ASD than TD (p<0.005). Although children with ASD had higher PAC values, in both groups gamma activity increased at the peak of the alpha oscillation. In addition, an association between alpha power and alpha-to-gamma PAC was observed in both groups, although this relationship was stronger in ASD than TD (p<0.05). Present results demonstrated that although alpha-to-gamma PAC is present in children, this basic RS process is abnormal in children with ASD. Finally, simulations and the human data highlighted the need to consider the interplay between alpha power, epoch length, and choice of signal processing methods on PAC estimates.},

@conference{Steward2015,
	abstract = {Background:  

Repetitive stereotyped behaviour is often described as a core symptom of autism spectrum disorder. There is, however, a disparity between how the scientific and broader autism communities view and describe these behaviours. Within the autism community, so-called repetitive behaviours are commonly described as ``stimming", and are considered an important coping mechanism. Also, many self advocates describe autism as an important part of themselves and inseparable from the rest of them (just like gender or sexuality) and therefore, for some, stimming would be considered part of this identity. Yet many of these reports are anecdotal, which means we know very little of peoples' actual experience of stimming.

Objectives:  

This research, conducted by an autistic self-advocate, sought to understand the experiences of stimming from people on the autism spectrum, specifically why the person feels that they stim, whether there are any benefits/pifalls, and whether they need additional support.

Methods:  

100 participants, ranging in age from 16 to 65 years, completed a 10-item online survey anonymously. Of the 100 participants, the majority (75%) had a formal diagnosis of an autism spectrum condition, and the remaining were self diagnosed, in the process of obtaining a diagnosis or answering on behalf of their autistic children. Participants were largely female (66%). participants were asked a range of questions, including why they stimmed, what kind of stims they had, had they been asked not to stim, and if they had always stimmed.

Results:  

Across participants, there were 11 types of commonly observed stims. The most commonly reported included rocking (48.94%), leg shaking (48.94%) and foot shaking (47.87%). In addition, people listed 73 other types of repetitive routine behaviours, compiled in Figure 1. Participants offered a wide range of reasons for why they stim. The most commonly cited reasons were to reduce anxiety  (71.88%), calm down (68.75%) and when overstimulated (57.29%). 80% of participants said they liked to stim generally or sometimes, 9% said they did not like to stim, and 11% said it depended on the stim.

Conclusions:  

People on the autism spectrum have a wide range of reasons for stimming, many of which suggested that they viewed stimming as a coping mechanism. Future research should extend this research to researchers and professionals in order to examine potential differences between autism and researcher/practitioner communities. Such research could provide a stimulus for discussion of the value of such behaviours in the lives of people on the autism spectrum.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUNDS: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are neurodevelopmental disorders that exhibit within-disorder heterogeneity and cross-disorder phenotypic overlap, thus suggesting that the current disease categories may not fully represent the etiologic essence of the disorders, especially for highly comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we explored the subtypes of a combined sample of ASD and ADHD by integrating measurements of behavior, cognition and brain imaging.
METHODS: A total of 164 participants, including 65 with ASD, 47 with ADHD, and 52 controls, were recruited. Unsupervised machine learning with an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm was used to identify transdiagnostic symptom clusters. Neurocognition and brain structural connectivity measurements were used to assess symptom clusters. Mediation analysis was used to explore the relationship between transdiagnostic symptoms, neurocognition and brain structural connectivity.
RESULTS: We identified three symptom clusters that did not fall within the diagnostic boundaries of DSM. External measurements from neurocognition and neuroimaging domains supported distinct profiles, including fine motor function, verbal fluency, and structural connectivity in the corpus callosum between these symptom clusters, highlighting possible biomarkers for ASD and ADHD. Additionally, fine motor function was shown to mediate the relationship between the corpus callosum and perseveration symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: In this transdiagnostic study on ASD and ADHD, we identified three subtypes showing meaningful associations between symptoms, neurocognition and brain white matter structural connectivity. The fine motor function and structural connectivity of corpus callosum might be used as biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders with social skill symptoms. The results of this study highlighted the importance of precise phenotyping and further supported the effects of fine motor intervention on ASD and ADHD.},

	abstract = {Within the parietal cortex, the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) seem to be involved in both spatial and nonspatial functions: Both areas are activated when misleading information is provided by invalid spatial cues in Posner's location-cueing paradigm, but also when infrequent deviant stimuli are presented within a series of standard events. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the distinct and shared brain responses to (i) invalidly cued targets requiring attentional reorienting, and (ii) to target stimuli deviating in color and orientation leading to an oddball-like distraction effect. Both unexpected location and feature changes were accompanied by a significant slowing of manual reaction times. Bilateral TPJ and right superior parietal lobe (SPL) activation was observed in response to invalidly as compared to validly cued targets. In contrast, the bilateral inferior occipito-temporal cortex, the left inferior parietal cortex, right frontal areas, and the cerebellum showed stronger activation in response to deviant than to standard targets. Common activations were observed in the right angular gyrus along the IPS and in the right inferior frontal gyrus. We conclude that the superior parietal and temporo-parietal activations observed here as well as previously in location-cueing paradigms do not merely reflect the detection and processing of unexpected stimuli. Furthermore, our data suggest that the right IPS and the inferior frontal gyrus are involved in attentional selection and distractor processing of both spatial and nonspatial features.},

	abstract = {Visuospatial attention can be deployed to different locations in space independently of ocular fixation, and studies have shown that event-related potential (ERP) components can effectively index whether such covert visuospatial attention is deployed to the left or right visual field. However, it is not clear whether we may obtain a more precise spatial localization of the focus of attention based on the EEG signals during central fixation. In this study, we used a modified Posner cueing task with an endogenous cue to determine the degree to which information in the EEG signal can be used to track visual spatial attention in presentation sequences lasting 200 ms. We used a machine learning classification method to evaluate how well EEG signals discriminate between four different locations of the focus of attention. We then used a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) and a leave-one-out cross-validation framework to evaluate the decoding accuracy (DA). We found that ERP-based features from occipital and parietal regions showed a statistically significant valid prediction of the location of the focus of visuospatial attention (DA = 57%, p < .001, chance-level 25%). The mean distance between the predicted and the true focus of attention was 0.62 letter positions, which represented a mean error of 0.55 degrees of visual angle. In addition, ERP responses also successfully predicted whether spatial attention was allocated or not to a given location with an accuracy of 79% (p < .001). These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for visuospatial attention decoding and future paths for research are proposed.},

	abstract = {The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) defines echolalia as a pathological, parrotlike, and apparently senseless repetition (echoing) of a word or phrase just uttered by another person and classifies this condition among the "restrictive and repetitive behaviours" of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The authors reviewed the existing literature on echolalia and its role in the development of children with ASD. Current conceptualizations include echolalia among repetitive behaviors and stereotypies and thus interpret this symptom as lacking any communicative significance, with negative effects on learning and sensory processing. Echoic behaviors, however, have been described in neurotypical infants and children as having a substantial effect on the consequent development of language and communication. Relevant research has documented a functional role of echolalia in ASD children as well since it facilitates the acquisition of verbal competencies and affords a higher degree of semantic generalization. This developmental function could be restricted to specific contexts. Considering echolalia as stereotypy and treating it as a disturbing symptom could impair the development of ASD-specific learning and communication processes. In light of this evidence, the authors propose a different conceptualization of echolalia and suggest that this symptom be considered among atypical communication patterns in children with ASD, with implications for treatment and prognosis.},

Seven functional categories of echolalia were discovered and are discussed in reference to behavioral and linguistic features of each category.

Shifts of attention were induced by central (endogenous) or peripheral (exogenous) cues. Reaction times on subsequently presented targets showed the expected pattern of facilitation and inhibition in both conditions. No difference in brain activity was observed when the two orienting conditions were contrasted with a liberal threshold, showing that both forms of orienting were mediated by the same neural network. Compared to within-block control trials, both endogenous and exogenous orienting activated a fronto-parietal network consisting of premotor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, medial frontal cortex and right inferior frontal cortex. Within these regions, equally strong activation was observed for both orienting conditions. It is concluded that endogenous and exogenous orienting are mediated by the same large-scale network of frontal and parietal brain areas.},

These criteria also provide the organising framework for much of the research focussing on these disorders. Study design, recruitment, analysis and theory are largely built on the assumption that diagnostic criteria reflect an underlying reality. However, there is growing concern that this assumption may not be a valid and that an alternative transdiagnostic approach may better serve our understanding of this large heterogeneous population of young people. This review draws on important developments over the past decade that have set the stage for much-needed breakthroughs in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. We evaluate contemporary approaches to study design and recruitment, review the use of data-driven methods to characterise cognition, behaviour and neurobiology, and consider what alternative transdiagnostic models could mean for children and families. This review concludes that an overreliance on ill-fitting diagnostic criteria is impeding progress towards identifying the barriers that children encounter, understanding underpinning mechanisms and finding the best route to supporting them.},

They are described in first-person accounts by people with autism as relaxing and that they help focus the mind and cope in overwhelming sensory environments. Therefore, we generally recommend against techniques that aim to suppress stereotypies in individuals with autism. Further, we hypothesize that understanding the neurobiology of stereotypies could guide development of treatments to produce the benefits of stereotypies without the need to generate repetitive motor movements. Here, we link first-person reports and clinical findings with basic neuroanatomy and physiology to produce a testable model of stereotypies. We hypothesize that stereotypies improve sensory processing and attention by regulating brain rhythms, either directly from the rhythmic motor command, or via rhythmic sensory feedback generated by the movements.},

Stereotypies begin before 3 years of age and continue into adulthood. Primary motor stereotypies occur in children of normal intelligence, whereas secondary stereotypies ensue in the setting of an additional diagnosis such as autism spectrum disorder or other neurologic disorders. They are highly associated with comorbidities such as anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, inattention, and tics. The pathophysiology of stereotypies involves fronto-striatal overactive dopaminergic pathways, and underactive cholinergic and GABAergic inhibitory pathways. No genetic markers have been identified despite a clear genetic predisposition. Behavioral therapy is the principle treatment. Future studies will focus on identifying genetic markers, and on better understanding the functional and structural neurobiology of these movements.},

@article{Leblanc2008,
	abstract = {Currently, there is considerable controversy regarding the degree to which top-down control can affect attentional capture by salient events. According to the contingent capture hypothesis, attentional capture by a salient stimulus is contingent on a match between the properties of the stimulus and top-down attentional control settings. In contrast, bottom-up saliency accounts argue that the initial capture of attention is determined solely by the relative salience of the stimulus, and the effect of top-down attentional control is limited to effects on the duration of attentional engagement on the capturing stimulus. In the present study, we tested these competing accounts by utilizing the N2pc event-related potential component to track the locus of attention during an attentional capture task. The results were completely consistent with the contingent capture hypothesis: An N2pc wave was elicited only by distractors that possessed the target-defining attribute. In a second experiment, we expanded upon this finding by exploring the effect of target-distractor similarity on the duration that attention dwells at the distractor location. In this experiment, only distractors possessing the target-defining attribute (color) captured visuospatial attention to their location and the N2pc increased in duration and in magnitude when the capture distractor also shared a second target attribute (category membership). Finally, in three additional control experiments, we replicated the finding of an N2pc generated by distractors, only if they shared the target-defining attribute. Thus, our results demonstrate that attentional control settings influence both which stimuli attract attention and to what extent they are processed.},

Supported by a growing body of scientific research, autistic adults argue that these behaviours may serve as useful coping mechanisms, yet little research has examined stimming from the perspective of autistic adults. Through interviews and focus groups, we asked 32 autistic adults to share their perceptions and experiences of stimming, including the reasons they stim, any value doing so may hold for them and their perceptions of others' reactions to stimming. Using thematic analysis, we identified two themes: stimming as (1) a self-regulatory mechanism and (2) lacking in social acceptance, but can become accepted through understanding. Autistic adults highlighted the importance of stimming as an adaptive mechanism that helps them to soothe or communicate intense emotions or thoughts and thus objected to treatment that aims to eliminate the behaviour.},

	abstract = {Attending to a cued location in space leads to faster reaction times when a stimulus is presented there. The reasons for this attentional effect, and its specific locus in the information-processing chain between stimulus and response, remain unclear. One suggestion is that attention speeds the conscious detection of stimuli. Surprisingly, this possibility appears not to have been tested directly. To resolve this question, we asked subjects to make simple responses to lateralised targets that followed either a valid, invalid or neutral cue, and to judge the perceived time of the target onset, or of their response, by delayed report of the position of a clock hand. Our results showed that only a small and non-significant part of the attentional effect is due to delayed conscious awareness of the stimulus. The greater part of the attentional effect is localised either subsequent to conscious detection of stimuli or occurs in a separate, parallel processing stream from that which generates the motor response.},

	abstract = {Adults with ADHD often report episodes of long-lasting, highly focused attention, a surprising report given their tendency to be distracted by irrelevant information. This has been colloquially termed "hyperfocus" (HF). Here, we introduce a novel assessment tool, the "Adult Hyperfocus Questionnaire" and test the preregistered a priori hypothesis that HF is more prevalent in individuals with high levels of ADHD symptomology. We assess (1) a pilot sample (n = 251) and (2) a replication sample (n = 372) of adults with or without ADHD. Participants completed highly validated scales, including the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale, to index ADHD symptomology. Those with higher ADHD symptomology reported higher total and dispositional HF and more frequent HF across each of the three settings (school, hobbies, and screen time) as well as on a fourth subscale describing real-world HF scenarios. These findings are both clinically and scientifically significant, as this is the first study to comprehensively assess HF in adults with high ADHD symptomology and to present a means for assessing HF. Moreover, the sizable prevalence of HF in adults with high levels of ADHD symptomology leads to a need to study it as a potentially separable feature of the ADHD syndrome.},

@article{Fitzgerald2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Attention orienting is a cognitive process that facilitates the movement of attention focus from one location to another: this may be impaired in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dorsal and ventral attention networks (DAN and VAN) sub-serve the process of attention orienting. This study investigated the functional connectivity of attention orienting in these networks in ASD using the Posner Cueing Task.
METHOD: Twenty-one adolescents with ASD and 21 age and IQ matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. A psychophysical interaction (PPI) analysis was implemented to investigate task-dependent functional connectivity, measuring synchronicity of brain regions during the task. Regions of interest (ROI) were selected to explore functional connectivity in the DAN during cue-only conditions and in the VAN during invalid and valid trials.
RESULTS: Behaviourally, the ASD and control groups performed the task in a similar manner. Functional MRI results indicated that the ASD and control groups activated similar brain regions. During invalid trials (VAN), the ASD group showed significant positive functional connectivity to multiple brain regions, whilst the control group demonstrated negative connectivity. During valid trials (VAN), the two groups also showed contrasting patterns of connectivity. In the cue-only conditions (DAN), the ASD group showed weaker functional connectivity.
CONCLUSION: The DAN analysis suggests that the ASD group has weaker coherence between brain areas involved in goal-driven, endogenous attention control. The strong positive functional connectivity exhibited by the ASD group in the VAN during the invalid trials suggests that individuals with ASD may generate compensatory mechanisms to achieve neurotypical behaviour. These results support the theory of abnormal cortical connectivity in autism.},

@article{Dupuis2022,
	abstract = {The comorbidity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnoses is well established. An ASD diagnosis is associated with elevated ADHD traits and symptoms, as well as strengths in attention. In the ASD literature, attentional strengths have been described as maladaptive (e.g., hyperfocus), in contrast with positive portrayals in the typically developing population (e.g., flow). The objective of this study was to (1) compare profiles of attentional strengths and weaknesses in ASD and ADHD and (2) determine whether attentional strengths in ASD are associated with impairment, poorer cognitive flexibility, and perseveration/perfectionism. In a community sample of 5,744 children and youth, 131 children were reported as having a diagnosis of ASD (mean age 10.3 years) and 346 children were reported as having a diagnosis of ADHD (mean age 10.7 years). We used the Strengths and Weaknesses of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity-symptoms and Normal-behaviors (SWAN) rating scale to calculate attentional and hyperactive/impulse control strength and weakness counts and scores. The Autism-Spectrum Quotient Switching factor served as a measure of cognitive flexibility. Impairment was assessed with the Columbia Impairment Scale. We used the symmetry/ordering factor on the Toronto Obsessive-Compulsive Scale as a measure of perseveration/perfectionism. No differences were found between the ADHD and ASD groups in SWAN weakness scores, symptoms, or hyperactive/impulse control strengths; however, autistic children had higher rates of attentional strengths [odds ratio: 5.7, 95% CI (2.8, 11.6), p < 0.0001]. Post-hoc pairwise testing identified four attentional strengths with significantly higher rates in ASD than in ADHD. Attentional strength scores were not associated with impairment or poor cognitive flexibility, but predicted levels of perseveration/perfectionism. The effect of attentional strengths on impairment and cognitive flexibility did not differ between autistic and Control children, but the higher perseveration/perfectionism scores seen in ASD were not found in Control children. ASD is associated with a pattern of attentional strengths that is not found in ADHD Characterizing the full range of attentional abilities in autistic children may explain variability in outcomes such as quality-of-life indicators and identify protective factors, providing targets for strength-based behavioral interventions. The clinical and etiological implications of the subgroup of autistic children with attentional strengths require further investigation.},

	abstract = {This investigation, consisting of two experiments, was designed to assess the effects of autistic immediate echolalia on acquisition and generalization of receptive labeling tasks. Experiment 1 addressed whether autistic children could use their echolalia to facilitate acquisition. The results indicated that incorporating echolalia (echo of the requested object's label) into the task before manual response (handing the requested object to the experimenter) facilitated receptive labeling. Experiment 2 was designed to determine the effects of incorporating echolalia into task response on acquisition and subsequent generalization. These results indicated that echolalia facilitated generalization for echolalic autistic children but not for functionally mute autistic children. The results of the experiments are discussed in terms of stimulus control. Additionally, it is proposed that perhaps in certain cases, echolalia should not be eliminated, but used to advantage in receptive responding.},

L., & Corbetta, M. Differential contribution of right and left parietal cortex to the control of spatial attention: A simultaneous EEG-rTMS study. Cerebral Cortex, 22, 446-454, 2012; Capotosto, P., Babiloni, C., Romani, G. L., & Corbetta, M. Fronto-parietal cortex controls spatial attention through modulation of anticipatory alpha rhythms. Journal of Neuroscience, 29, 5863-5872, 2009]. Here we combine data from our previous studies to examine whether right parietal TMS during spatial orienting also impairs stimulus-driven reorienting or the ability to efficiently process unattended stimuli, that is, stimuli outside the current focus of attention. Healthy volunteers (n = 24) performed a Posner spatial cueing task while their EEG activity was being monitored. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) was applied for 150 msec simultaneously to the presentation of a central arrow directing spatial attention to the location of an upcoming visual target. Right IPS-rTMS impaired target detection, especially for stimuli presented at unattended locations; it also caused a modulation of the amplitude of parieto-occipital positive ERPs peaking at about 480 msec (P3) post-target. The P3 significantly decreased for unattended targets and significantly increased for attended targets after right IPS-rTMS as compared with sham stimulation. Similar effects were obtained for left IPS stimulation albeit in a smaller group of volunteers. We conclude that disruption of anticipatory processes in right IPS has prolonged effects that persist during target processing. The P3 decrement may reflect interference with postdecision processes that are part of stimulus-driven reorienting. Right IPS is a node of functional interaction between endogenous spatial orienting and stimulus-driven reorienting processes in human vision.},

This is in no doubt due to the importance of normal attention function to the development of many so-called "higher level" cognitive operations, and to the likely involvement of attention dysfunction in certain clinical features of autism. Autistic individuals display a wide range of attentional abilities and deficits across the many domains of attention function, including selective, sustained, spatial, and shifting attention operations. This unique pattern of attention function and dysfunction has profound implications for the development and treatment of autistic children.
